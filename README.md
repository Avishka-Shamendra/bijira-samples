# Bijira Samples
This repository contains API proxy samples for WSO2 Bijira


## Adding a New Sample

To add a new sample, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory in the `bijira-samples` directory with the name of the sample.
2. Add a `README.md` file to the new directory with the sample details.
3. Add other necessary files to the directory.
4. Add any icons or images to the `.samples/icons` directory.
5. Update the `.samples/index.json` file with the new sample details.

**Be cautious as updating the index.json file will directly add the sample to the Bijira UI.**
